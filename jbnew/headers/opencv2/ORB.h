/**
 * Class implementing the ORB (*oriented BRIEF*) keypoint detector and descriptor extractor
 *
 * described in CITE: RRKB11 . The algorithm uses FAST in pyramids to detect stable keypoints, selects
 * the strongest features using FAST or Harris response, finds their orientation using first-order
 * moments and computes the descriptors using BRIEF (where the coordinates of random point pairs (or
 * k-tuples) are rotated according to the measured orientation).

 * Member of `Features2d`

/**
 * The ORB constructor
 *
 * @param nfeatures The maximum number of features to retain.
 * @param scaleFactor Pyramid decimation ratio, greater than 1. scaleFactor==2 means the classical
 *     pyramid, where each next level has 4x less pixels than the previous, but such a big scale factor
 *     will degrade feature matching scores dramatically. On the other hand, too close to 1 scale factor
 *     will mean that to cover certain scale range you will need more pyramid levels and so the speed
 *     will suffer.
 * @param nlevels The number of pyramid levels. The smallest level will have linear size equal to
 *     input_image_linear_size/pow(scaleFactor, nlevels - firstLevel).
 * @param edgeThreshold This is size of the border where the features are not detected. It should
 *     roughly match the patchSize parameter.
 * @param firstLevel The level of pyramid to put source image to. Previous layers are filled
 *     with upscaled source image.
 * @param WTA_K The number of points that produce each element of the oriented BRIEF descriptor. The
 *     default value 2 means the BRIEF where we take a random point pair and compare their brightnesses,
 *     so we get 0/1 response. Other possible values are 3 and 4. For example, 3 means that we take 3
 *     random points (of course, those point coordinates are random, but they are generated from the
 *     pre-defined seed, so each element of BRIEF descriptor is computed deterministically from the pixel
 *     rectangle), find point of maximum brightness and output index of the winner (0, 1 or 2). Such
 *     output will occupy 2 bits, and therefore it will need a special variant of Hamming distance,
 *     denoted as NORM_HAMMING2 (2 bits per bin). When WTA_K=4, we take 4 random points to compute each
 *     bin (that will also occupy 2 bits with possible values 0, 1, 2 or 3).
 * @param scoreType The default HARRIS_SCORE means that Harris algorithm is used to rank features
 *     (the score is written to KeyPoint::score and is used to retain best nfeatures features);
 *     FAST_SCORE is alternative value of the parameter that produces slightly less stable keypoints,
 *     but it is a little faster to compute.
 * @param patchSize size of the patch used by the oriented BRIEF descriptor. Of course, on smaller
 *     pyramid layers the perceived image area covered by a feature will be larger.
 * @param fastThreshold the fast threshold
