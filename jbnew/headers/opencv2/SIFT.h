 *     number of octaves is computed automatically from the image resolution.
 *
 * @param contrastThreshold The contrast threshold used to filter out weak features in semi-uniform
 *     (low-contrast) regions. The larger the threshold, the less features are produced by the detector.
 *
 *     NOTE: The contrast threshold will be divided by nOctaveLayers when the filtering is applied. When
 *     nOctaveLayers is set to default and if you want to use the value used in D. Lowe paper, 0.03, set
 *     this argument to 0.09.

 * @param edgeThreshold The threshold used to filter out edge-like features. Note that the its meaning
 *     is different from the contrastThreshold, i.e. the larger the edgeThreshold, the less features are
 *     filtered out (more features are retained).
 *
 * @param sigma The sigma of the Gaussian applied to the input image at the octave \#0. If your image
 *     is captured with a weak camera with soft lenses, you might want to reduce the number.
