/**
 * Restores the selected region in an image using the region neighborhood.
 *
 * @param src Input 8-bit, 16-bit unsigned or 32-bit float 1-channel or 8-bit 3-channel image.
 * @param inpaintMask Inpainting mask, 8-bit 1-channel image. Non-zero pixels indicate the area that
 * needs to be inpainted.
 * @param dst Output image with the same size and type as src .
 * @param inpaintRadius Radius of a circular neighborhood of each point inpainted that is considered
 * by the algorithm.
 * @param flags Inpainting method that could be cv::INPAINT_NS or cv::INPAINT_TELEA
 *
 * The function reconstructs the selected image area from the pixel near the area boundary. The
 * function may be used to remove dust and scratches from a scanned photo, or to remove undesirable
 * objects from still images or video. See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpainting> for more details.
