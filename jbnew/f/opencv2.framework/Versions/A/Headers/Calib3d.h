 * then the point `$$i$$` is considered as an outlier. If srcPoints and dstPoints are measured in pixels,
 * it usually makes sense to set this parameter somewhere in the range of 1 to 10.
 * @param mask Optional output mask set by a robust method ( RANSAC or LMeDS ). Note that the input

 * @param maxIters The maximum number of RANSAC iterations.

 * pairs to compute an initial homography estimate with a simple least-squares scheme.
 *
 * However, if not all of the point pairs ( `$$srcPoints_i$$`, `$$dstPoints_i$$` ) fit the rigid perspective
 * transformation (that is, there are some outliers), this initial estimate will be poor. In this case,
 * you can use one of the three robust methods. The methods RANSAC, LMeDS and RHO try many different
 * random subsets of the corresponding point pairs (of four pairs each, collinear pairs are discarded), estimate the homography matrix
 * using this subset and a simple least-squares algorithm, and then compute the quality/goodness of the
 * computed homography (which is the number of inliers for RANSAC or the least median re-projection error for
 * LMeDS). The best subset is then used to produce the initial estimate of the homography matrix and
 * the mask of inliers/outliers.
 *
 * Regardless of the method, robust or not, the computed homography matrix is refined further (using
 * inliers only in case of a robust method) with the Levenberg-Marquardt method to reduce the
 * re-projection error even more.
 *
 * The methods RANSAC and RHO can handle practically any ratio of outliers but need a threshold to

 *
 * The function is used to find initial intrinsic and extrinsic matrices. Homography matrix is

/**
 * Finds a perspective transformation between two planes.
 *
 * @param srcPoints Coordinates of the points in the original plane, a matrix of the type CV_32FC2
 * or vector\<Point2f\> .
 * @param dstPoints Coordinates of the points in the target plane, a matrix of the type CV_32FC2 or
 * a vector\<Point2f\> .
 * @param method Method used to compute a homography matrix. The following methods are possible:
 * -   **0** - a regular method using all the points, i.e., the least squares method
 * -   REF: RANSAC - RANSAC-based robust method
 * -   REF: LMEDS - Least-Median robust method
 * -   REF: RHO - PROSAC-based robust method
 * @param ransacReprojThreshold Maximum allowed reprojection error to treat a point pair as an inlier
 * (used in the RANSAC and RHO methods only). That is, if
 * `$$\| \texttt{dstPoints} _i -  \texttt{convertPointsHomogeneous} ( \texttt{H} * \texttt{srcPoints} _i) \|_2  >  \texttt{ransacReprojThreshold}$$`
 * then the point `$$i$$` is considered as an outlier. If srcPoints and dstPoints are measured in pixels,
 * it usually makes sense to set this parameter somewhere in the range of 1 to 10.
 * mask values are ignored.
 *
 * The function finds and returns the perspective transformation `$$H$$` between the source and the
 * destination planes:
 *
 * `$$s_i  \vecthree{x'_i}{y'_i}{1} \sim H  \vecthree{x_i}{y_i}{1}$$`
 *
 * so that the back-projection error
 *
 * `$$\sum _i \left ( x'_i- \frac{h_{11} x_i + h_{12} y_i + h_{13}}{h_{31} x_i + h_{32} y_i + h_{33}} \right )^2+ \left ( y'_i- \frac{h_{21} x_i + h_{22} y_i + h_{23}}{h_{31} x_i + h_{32} y_i + h_{33}} \right )^2$$`
 *
 * is minimized. If the parameter method is set to the default value 0, the function uses all the point
 * pairs to compute an initial homography estimate with a simple least-squares scheme.
 *
 * However, if not all of the point pairs ( `$$srcPoints_i$$`, `$$dstPoints_i$$` ) fit the rigid perspective
 * transformation (that is, there are some outliers), this initial estimate will be poor. In this case,
 * you can use one of the three robust methods. The methods RANSAC, LMeDS and RHO try many different
 * random subsets of the corresponding point pairs (of four pairs each, collinear pairs are discarded), estimate the homography matrix
 * using this subset and a simple least-squares algorithm, and then compute the quality/goodness of the
 * computed homography (which is the number of inliers for RANSAC or the least median re-projection error for
 * LMeDS). The best subset is then used to produce the initial estimate of the homography matrix and
 * the mask of inliers/outliers.
 *
 * Regardless of the method, robust or not, the computed homography matrix is refined further (using
 * inliers only in case of a robust method) with the Levenberg-Marquardt method to reduce the
 * re-projection error even more.
 *
 * The methods RANSAC and RHO can handle practically any ratio of outliers but need a threshold to
 * distinguish inliers from outliers. The method LMeDS does not need any threshold but it works
 * correctly only when there are more than 50% of inliers. Finally, if there are no outliers and the
 * noise is rather small, use the default method (method=0).
 *
 * The function is used to find initial intrinsic and extrinsic matrices. Homography matrix is
 * determined up to a scale. Thus, it is normalized so that `$$h_{33}=1$$`. Note that whenever an `$$H$$` matrix
 * cannot be estimated, an empty one will be returned.

 * NOTE:
 *    -   An example of how to use solvePnP for planar augmented reality can be found at
 *         opencv_source_code/samples/python/plane_ar.py
 *    -   If you are using Python:
 *         - Numpy array slices won't work as input because solvePnP requires contiguous
 *         arrays (enforced by the assertion using cv::Mat::checkVector() around line 55 of
 *         modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
 *         - The P3P algorithm requires image points to be in an array of shape (N,1,2) due
 *         to its calling of #undistortPoints (around line 75 of modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
 *         which requires 2-channel information.
 *         - Thus, given some data D = np.array(...) where D.shape = (N,M), in order to use a subset of
 *         it as, e.g., imagePoints, one must effectively copy it into a new array: imagePoints =
 *         np.ascontiguousarray(D[:,:2]).reshape((N,1,2))
 *    -   The methods REF: SOLVEPNP_DLS and REF: SOLVEPNP_UPNP cannot be used as the current implementations are
 *        unstable and sometimes give completely wrong results. If you pass one of these two
 *        flags, REF: SOLVEPNP_EPNP method will be used instead.
 *    -   The minimum number of points is 4 in the general case. In the case of REF: SOLVEPNP_P3P and REF: SOLVEPNP_AP3P
 *        methods, it is required to use exactly 4 points (the first 3 points are used to estimate all the solutions
 *        of the P3P problem, the last one is used to retain the best solution that minimizes the reprojection error).
 *    -   With REF: SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE method and `useExtrinsicGuess=true`, the minimum number of points is 3 (3 points
 *        are sufficient to compute a pose but there are up to 4 solutions). The initial solution should be close to the
 *        global solution to converge.
 *    -   With REF: SOLVEPNP_IPPE input points must be >= 4 and object points must be coplanar.
 *    -   With REF: SOLVEPNP_IPPE_SQUARE this is a special case suitable for marker pose estimation.
 *        Number of input points must be 4. Object points must be defined in the following order:
 *          - point 0: [-squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
 *          - point 1: [ squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
 *          - point 2: [ squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
 *          - point 3: [-squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
 *     -  With REF: SOLVEPNP_SQPNP input points must be >= 3

 * NOTE:
 *    -   An example of how to use solvePnP for planar augmented reality can be found at
 *         opencv_source_code/samples/python/plane_ar.py
 *    -   If you are using Python:
 *         - Numpy array slices won't work as input because solvePnP requires contiguous
 *         arrays (enforced by the assertion using cv::Mat::checkVector() around line 55 of
 *         modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
 *         - The P3P algorithm requires image points to be in an array of shape (N,1,2) due
 *         to its calling of #undistortPoints (around line 75 of modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
 *         which requires 2-channel information.
 *         - Thus, given some data D = np.array(...) where D.shape = (N,M), in order to use a subset of
 *         it as, e.g., imagePoints, one must effectively copy it into a new array: imagePoints =
 *         np.ascontiguousarray(D[:,:2]).reshape((N,1,2))
 *    -   The methods REF: SOLVEPNP_DLS and REF: SOLVEPNP_UPNP cannot be used as the current implementations are
 *        unstable and sometimes give completely wrong results. If you pass one of these two
 *        flags, REF: SOLVEPNP_EPNP method will be used instead.
 *    -   The minimum number of points is 4 in the general case. In the case of REF: SOLVEPNP_P3P and REF: SOLVEPNP_AP3P
 *        methods, it is required to use exactly 4 points (the first 3 points are used to estimate all the solutions
 *        of the P3P problem, the last one is used to retain the best solution that minimizes the reprojection error).
 *    -   With REF: SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE method and `useExtrinsicGuess=true`, the minimum number of points is 3 (3 points
 *        are sufficient to compute a pose but there are up to 4 solutions). The initial solution should be close to the
 *        global solution to converge.
 *    -   With REF: SOLVEPNP_IPPE input points must be >= 4 and object points must be coplanar.
 *    -   With REF: SOLVEPNP_IPPE_SQUARE this is a special case suitable for marker pose estimation.
 *        Number of input points must be 4. Object points must be defined in the following order:
 *          - point 0: [-squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]

 *         - The P3P algorithm requires image points to be in an array of shape (N,1,2) due
 *         to its calling of #undistortPoints (around line 75 of modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
 *         which requires 2-channel information.
 *         - Thus, given some data D = np.array(...) where D.shape = (N,M), in order to use a subset of
 *         it as, e.g., imagePoints, one must effectively copy it into a new array: imagePoints =
 *         np.ascontiguousarray(D[:,:2]).reshape((N,1,2))
 *    -   The methods REF: SOLVEPNP_DLS and REF: SOLVEPNP_UPNP cannot be used as the current implementations are

 *        flags, REF: SOLVEPNP_EPNP method will be used instead.
 *    -   The minimum number of points is 4 in the general case. In the case of REF: SOLVEPNP_P3P and REF: SOLVEPNP_AP3P
 *        methods, it is required to use exactly 4 points (the first 3 points are used to estimate all the solutions
 *        of the P3P problem, the last one is used to retain the best solution that minimizes the reprojection error).
 *    -   With REF: SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE method and `useExtrinsicGuess=true`, the minimum number of points is 3 (3 points
 *        are sufficient to compute a pose but there are up to 4 solutions). The initial solution should be close to the

 * NOTE:
 *    -   An example of how to use solvePnP for planar augmented reality can be found at
 *         opencv_source_code/samples/python/plane_ar.py
 *    -   If you are using Python:
 *         - Numpy array slices won't work as input because solvePnP requires contiguous
 *         arrays (enforced by the assertion using cv::Mat::checkVector() around line 55 of
 *         modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
 *         - The P3P algorithm requires image points to be in an array of shape (N,1,2) due
 *         to its calling of #undistortPoints (around line 75 of modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
 *         which requires 2-channel information.
 *         - Thus, given some data D = np.array(...) where D.shape = (N,M), in order to use a subset of
 *         it as, e.g., imagePoints, one must effectively copy it into a new array: imagePoints =
 *         np.ascontiguousarray(D[:,:2]).reshape((N,1,2))
 *    -   The methods REF: SOLVEPNP_DLS and REF: SOLVEPNP_UPNP cannot be used as the current implementations are
 *        unstable and sometimes give completely wrong results. If you pass one of these two
 *        flags, REF: SOLVEPNP_EPNP method will be used instead.
 *    -   The minimum number of points is 4 in the general case. In the case of REF: SOLVEPNP_P3P and REF: SOLVEPNP_AP3P
 *        methods, it is required to use exactly 4 points (the first 3 points are used to estimate all the solutions
 *        of the P3P problem, the last one is used to retain the best solution that minimizes the reprojection error).
 *    -   With REF: SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE method and `useExtrinsicGuess=true`, the minimum number of points is 3 (3 points
 *        are sufficient to compute a pose but there are up to 4 solutions). The initial solution should be close to the
 *        global solution to converge.
 *    -   With REF: SOLVEPNP_IPPE input points must be >= 4 and object points must be coplanar.
 *    -   With REF: SOLVEPNP_IPPE_SQUARE this is a special case suitable for marker pose estimation.
 *        Number of input points must be 4. Object points must be defined in the following order:
 *          - point 0: [-squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
 *          - point 1: [ squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
 *          - point 2: [ squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
 *          - point 3: [-squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]

 * This should be used if an accurate camera calibration is required.
 * @param meta Optional output arrray of detected corners (CV_8UC1 and size = cv::Size(columns,rows)).
 * Each entry stands for one corner of the pattern and can have one of the following values:
 * -   0 = no meta data attached
 * -   1 = left-top corner of a black cell
 * -   2 = left-top corner of a white cell
 * -   3 = left-top corner of a black cell with a white marker dot

 *
 * The function is analog to #findChessboardCorners but uses a localized radon
 * transformation approximated by box filters being more robust to all sort of
 * noise, faster on larger images and is able to directly return the sub-pixel
 * position of the internal chessboard corners. The Method is based on the paper
 * CITE: duda2018 "Accurate Detection and Localization of Checkerboard Corners for
 * Calibration" demonstrating that the returned sub-pixel positions are more
 * accurate than the one returned by cornerSubPix allowing a precise camera
 * calibration for demanding applications.
 *
 * In the case, the flags REF: CALIB_CB_LARGER or REF: CALIB_CB_MARKER are given,
 * the result can be recovered from the optional meta array. Both flags are
 * helpful to use calibration patterns exceeding the field of view of the camera.
 * These oversized patterns allow more accurate calibrations as corners can be
 * utilized, which are as close as possible to the image borders.  For a
 * consistent coordinate system across all images, the optional marker (see image
 * below) can be used to move the origin of the board to the location where the
 * black circle is located.
 *
 * NOTE: The function requires a white boarder with roughly the same width as one
 * of the checkerboard fields around the whole board to improve the detection in
 * various environments. In addition, because of the localized radon
 * transformation it is beneficial to use round corners for the field corners
 * which are located on the outside of the board. The following figure illustrates
 * a sample checkerboard optimized for the detection. However, any other checkerboard
 * can be used as well.

 * In the old interface all the vectors of object points from different views are concatenated

 * @param imagePoints In the new interface it is a vector of vectors of the projections of calibration

 * concatenated together.
 * @param imageSize Size of the image used only to initialize the camera intrinsic matrix.
 * @param cameraMatrix Input/output 3x3 floating-point camera intrinsic matrix
 * `$$\cameramatrix{A}$$` . If REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS
 * and/or REF: CALIB_FIX_ASPECT_RATIO, REF: CALIB_FIX_PRINCIPAL_POINT or REF: CALIB_FIX_FOCAL_LENGTH
 * are specified, some or all of fx, fy, cx, cy must be initialized before calling the function.
 * @param distCoeffs Input/output vector of distortion coefficients
 * `$$\distcoeffs$$`.
 * @param rvecs Output vector of rotation vectors (REF: Rodrigues ) estimated for each pattern view
 * (e.g. std::vector<cv::Mat>>). That is, each i-th rotation vector together with the corresponding
 * i-th translation vector (see the next output parameter description) brings the calibration pattern
 * from the object coordinate space (in which object points are specified) to the camera coordinate
 * space. In more technical terms, the tuple of the i-th rotation and translation vector performs
 * a change of basis from object coordinate space to camera coordinate space. Due to its duality, this

 * @param stdDeviationsExtrinsics Output vector of standard deviations estimated for extrinsic

 * the number of pattern views. `$$R_i, T_i$$` are concatenated 1x3 vectors.
 * @param perViewErrors Output vector of the RMS re-projection error estimated for each pattern view.
 * @param flags Different flags that may be zero or a combination of the following values:
 * -   REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS cameraMatrix contains valid initial values of
 * fx, fy, cx, cy that are optimized further. Otherwise, (cx, cy) is initially set to the image
 * center ( imageSize is used), and focal distances are computed in a least-squares fashion.
 * Note, that if intrinsic parameters are known, there is no need to use this function just to
 * estimate extrinsic parameters. Use REF: solvePnP instead.
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_PRINCIPAL_POINT The principal point is not changed during the global
 * optimization. It stays at the center or at a different location specified when
 *  REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set too.
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_ASPECT_RATIO The functions consider only fy as a free parameter. The
 * ratio fx/fy stays the same as in the input cameraMatrix . When
 *  REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is not set, the actual input values of fx and fy are
 * ignored, only their ratio is computed and used further.
 * -   REF: CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST Tangential distortion coefficients `$$(p_1, p_2)$$` are set
 * to zeros and stay zero.
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_FOCAL_LENGTH The focal length is not changed during the global optimization if
 *  REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set.
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_K1,..., REF: CALIB_FIX_K6 The corresponding radial distortion
 * coefficient is not changed during the optimization. If REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is
 * set, the coefficient from the supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
 * -   REF: CALIB_RATIONAL_MODEL Coefficients k4, k5, and k6 are enabled. To provide the
 * backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
 * calibration function use the rational model and return 8 coefficients or more.
 * -   REF: CALIB_THIN_PRISM_MODEL Coefficients s1, s2, s3 and s4 are enabled. To provide the
 * backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
 * calibration function use the thin prism model and return 12 coefficients or more.

 * the optimization. If REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set, the coefficient from the
 * supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
 * -   REF: CALIB_TILTED_MODEL Coefficients tauX and tauY are enabled. To provide the
 * backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
 * calibration function use the tilted sensor model and return 14 coefficients.
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_TAUX_TAUY The coefficients of the tilted sensor model are not changed during
 * the optimization. If REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set, the coefficient from the
 * supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
 * @param criteria Termination criteria for the iterative optimization algorithm.
 *
 * @return the overall RMS re-projection error.
 *
 * The function estimates the intrinsic camera parameters and extrinsic parameters for each of the
 * views. The algorithm is based on CITE: Zhang2000 and CITE: BouguetMCT . The coordinates of 3D object
 * points and their corresponding 2D projections in each view must be specified. That may be achieved
 * by using an object with known geometry and easily detectable feature points. Such an object is
 * called a calibration rig or calibration pattern, and OpenCV has built-in support for a chessboard as
 * a calibration rig (see REF: findChessboardCorners). Currently, initialization of intrinsic
 * parameters (when REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is not set) is only implemented for planar calibration
 * patterns (where Z-coordinates of the object points must be all zeros). 3D calibration rigs can also
 * be used as long as initial cameraMatrix is provided.
 *
 * The algorithm performs the following steps:
 *
 * -   Compute the initial intrinsic parameters (the option only available for planar calibration
 *     patterns) or read them from the input parameters. The distortion coefficients are all set to
 *     zeros initially unless some of CALIB_FIX_K? are specified.
 *
 * -   Estimate the initial camera pose as if the intrinsic parameters have been already known. This is
 *     done using REF: solvePnP .
 *
 * -   Run the global Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm to minimize the reprojection error,
 *     that is, the total sum of squared distances between the observed feature points imagePoints and
 *     the projected (using the current estimates for camera parameters and the poses) object points
 *     objectPoints. See REF: projectPoints for details.
 *
 * NOTE:
 *     If you use a non-square (i.e. non-N-by-N) grid and REF: findChessboardCorners for calibration,
 *     and REF: calibrateCamera returns bad values (zero distortion coefficients, `$$c_x$$` and
 *     `$$c_y$$` very far from the image center, and/or large differences between `$$f_x$$` and
 *     `$$f_y$$` (ratios of 10:1 or more)), then you are probably using patternSize=cvSize(rows,cols)
 *     instead of using patternSize=cvSize(cols,rows) in REF: findChessboardCorners.

/**
 * Finds the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from several views of a calibration pattern.

 * @param imageSize Size of the image used only to initialize the camera intrinsic matrices.
 * @param R Output rotation matrix. Together with the translation vector T, this matrix brings
 * points given in the first camera's coordinate system to points in the second camera's
 * coordinate system. In more technical terms, the tuple of R and T performs a change of basis
 * from the first camera's coordinate system to the second camera's coordinate system. Due to its
 * duality, this tuple is equivalent to the position of the first camera with respect to the
 * second camera coordinate system.
 * @param T Output translation vector, see description above.
 * @param E Output essential matrix.
 * @param F Output fundamental matrix.
 * @param perViewErrors Output vector of the RMS re-projection error estimated for each pattern view.
 * @param flags Different flags that may be zero or a combination of the following values:

 * matrices are estimated.
 * -   REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS Optimize some or all of the intrinsic parameters
 * according to the specified flags. Initial values are provided by the user.
 * -   REF: CALIB_USE_EXTRINSIC_GUESS R and T contain valid initial values that are optimized further.
 * Otherwise R and T are initialized to the median value of the pattern views (each dimension separately).
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_PRINCIPAL_POINT Fix the principal points during the optimization.
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_FOCAL_LENGTH Fix `$$f^{(j)}_x$$` and `$$f^{(j)}_y$$` .
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_ASPECT_RATIO Optimize `$$f^{(j)}_y$$` . Fix the ratio `$$f^{(j)}_x/f^{(j)}_y$$`
 * .

 * -   REF: CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST Set tangential distortion coefficients for each camera to
 * zeros and fix there.
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_K1,..., REF: CALIB_FIX_K6 Do not change the corresponding radial
 * distortion coefficient during the optimization. If REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set,
 * the coefficient from the supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
 * -   REF: CALIB_RATIONAL_MODEL Enable coefficients k4, k5, and k6. To provide the backward

 * function use the rational model and return 8 coefficients. If the flag is not set, the
 * function computes and returns only 5 distortion coefficients.
 * -   REF: CALIB_THIN_PRISM_MODEL Coefficients s1, s2, s3 and s4 are enabled. To provide the
 * backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
 * calibration function use the thin prism model and return 12 coefficients. If the flag is not
 * set, the function computes and returns only 5 distortion coefficients.
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_S1_S2_S3_S4 The thin prism distortion coefficients are not changed during
 * the optimization. If REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set, the coefficient from the
 * supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
 * -   REF: CALIB_TILTED_MODEL Coefficients tauX and tauY are enabled. To provide the
 * backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
 * calibration function use the tilted sensor model and return 14 coefficients. If the flag is not
 * set, the function computes and returns only 5 distortion coefficients.
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_TAUX_TAUY The coefficients of the tilted sensor model are not changed during
 * the optimization. If REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set, the coefficient from the
 * supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
 * @param criteria Termination criteria for the iterative optimization algorithm.
 *
 * The function estimates the transformation between two cameras making a stereo pair. If one computes
 * the poses of an object relative to the first camera and to the second camera,
 * ( `$$R_1$$`,`$$T_1$$` ) and (`$$R_2$$`,`$$T_2$$`), respectively, for a stereo camera where the
 * relative position and orientation between the two cameras are fixed, then those poses definitely
 * relate to each other. This means, if the relative position and orientation (`$$R$$`,`$$T$$`) of the
 * two cameras is known, it is possible to compute (`$$R_2$$`,`$$T_2$$`) when (`$$R_1$$`,`$$T_1$$`) is
 * given. This is what the described function does. It computes (`$$R$$`,`$$T$$`) such that:
 *
 * `$$R_2=R R_1$$`
 * `$$T_2=R T_1 + T.$$`
 *
 * Therefore, one can compute the coordinate representation of a 3D point for the second camera's
 * coordinate system when given the point's coordinate representation in the first camera's coordinate
 * system:
 *
 * `$$\begin{bmatrix}
 * X_2 \\
 * Y_2 \\
 * Z_2 \\
 * 1
 * \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
 * R & T \\
 * 0 & 1
 * \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
 * X_1 \\
 * Y_1 \\
 * Z_1 \\
 * 1
 * \end{bmatrix}.$$`
 *
 *
 * Optionally, it computes the essential matrix E:
 *
 * `$$\newcommand{\vecthreethree}[9]{ \begin{bmatrix} #1 & #2 & #3\\\\ #4 & #5 & #6\\\\ #7 & #8 & #9 \end{bmatrix} } E= \vecthreethree{0}{-T_2}{T_1}{T_2}{0}{-T_0}{-T_1}{T_0}{0} R$$`
 *
 * where `$$T_i$$` are components of the translation vector `$$T$$` : `$$T=[T_0, T_1, T_2]^T$$` .
 * And the function can also compute the fundamental matrix F:
 *
 * `$$F = cameraMatrix2^{-T}\cdot E \cdot cameraMatrix1^{-1}$$`
 *
 * Besides the stereo-related information, the function can also perform a full calibration of each of
 * the two cameras. However, due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space and noise in the
 * input data, the function can diverge from the correct solution. If the intrinsic parameters can be
 * estimated with high accuracy for each of the cameras individually (for example, using
 * #calibrateCamera ), you are recommended to do so and then pass REF: CALIB_FIX_INTRINSIC flag to the
 * function along with the computed intrinsic parameters. Otherwise, if all the parameters are
 * estimated at once, it makes sense to restrict some parameters, for example, pass
 *  REF: CALIB_SAME_FOCAL_LENGTH and REF: CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST flags, which is usually a
 * reasonable assumption.
 *
 * Similarly to #calibrateCamera, the function minimizes the total re-projection error for all the
 * points in all the available views from both cameras. The function returns the final value of the
 * re-projection error.

 * -   REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS Optimize some or all of the intrinsic parameters
 * according to the specified flags. Initial values are provided by the user.
 * -   REF: CALIB_USE_EXTRINSIC_GUESS R and T contain valid initial values that are optimized further.
 * Otherwise R and T are initialized to the median value of the pattern views (each dimension separately).
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_PRINCIPAL_POINT Fix the principal points during the optimization.
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_FOCAL_LENGTH Fix `$$f^{(j)}_x$$` and `$$f^{(j)}_y$$` .
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_ASPECT_RATIO Optimize `$$f^{(j)}_y$$` . Fix the ratio `$$f^{(j)}_x/f^{(j)}_y$$`
 * .

 * -   REF: CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST Set tangential distortion coefficients for each camera to

 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_K1,..., REF: CALIB_FIX_K6 Do not change the corresponding radial
 * distortion coefficient during the optimization. If REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set,
 * the coefficient from the supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
 * -   REF: CALIB_RATIONAL_MODEL Enable coefficients k4, k5, and k6. To provide the backward
 * compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the calibration
 * function use the rational model and return 8 coefficients. If the flag is not set, the
 * function computes and returns only 5 distortion coefficients.
 * -   REF: CALIB_THIN_PRISM_MODEL Coefficients s1, s2, s3 and s4 are enabled. To provide the
 * backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
 * calibration function use the thin prism model and return 12 coefficients. If the flag is not
 * set, the function computes and returns only 5 distortion coefficients.
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_S1_S2_S3_S4 The thin prism distortion coefficients are not changed during
 * the optimization. If REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set, the coefficient from the
 * supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
 * -   REF: CALIB_TILTED_MODEL Coefficients tauX and tauY are enabled. To provide the
 * backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
 * calibration function use the tilted sensor model and return 14 coefficients. If the flag is not
 * set, the function computes and returns only 5 distortion coefficients.
 * -   REF: CALIB_FIX_TAUX_TAUY The coefficients of the tilted sensor model are not changed during
 * the optimization. If REF: CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set, the coefficient from the
 * supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
 *
 * The function estimates the transformation between two cameras making a stereo pair. If one computes
 * the poses of an object relative to the first camera and to the second camera,
 * ( `$$R_1$$`,`$$T_1$$` ) and (`$$R_2$$`,`$$T_2$$`), respectively, for a stereo camera where the
 * relative position and orientation between the two cameras are fixed, then those poses definitely
 * relate to each other. This means, if the relative position and orientation (`$$R$$`,`$$T$$`) of the
 * two cameras is known, it is possible to compute (`$$R_2$$`,`$$T_2$$`) when (`$$R_1$$`,`$$T_1$$`) is
 * given. This is what the described function does. It computes (`$$R$$`,`$$T$$`) such that:
 *
 * `$$R_2=R R_1$$`
 * `$$T_2=R T_1 + T.$$`
 *
 * Therefore, one can compute the coordinate representation of a 3D point for the second camera's
 * coordinate system when given the point's coordinate representation in the first camera's coordinate
 * system:
 *
 * `$$\begin{bmatrix}
 * X_2 \\
 * Y_2 \\
 * Z_2 \\
 * 1
 * \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
 * R & T \\
 * 0 & 1
 * \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
 * X_1 \\
 * Y_1 \\
 * Z_1 \\
 * 1
 * \end{bmatrix}.$$`
 *
 *
 * Optionally, it computes the essential matrix E:
 *
 * `$$\newcommand{\vecthreethree}[9]{ \begin{bmatrix} #1 & #2 & #3\\\\ #4 & #5 & #6\\\\ #7 & #8 & #9 \end{bmatrix} } E= \vecthreethree{0}{-T_2}{T_1}{T_2}{0}{-T_0}{-T_1}{T_0}{0} R$$`
 *
 * where `$$T_i$$` are components of the translation vector `$$T$$` : `$$T=[T_0, T_1, T_2]^T$$` .
 * And the function can also compute the fundamental matrix F:
 *
 * `$$F = cameraMatrix2^{-T}\cdot E \cdot cameraMatrix1^{-1}$$`
 *
 * Besides the stereo-related information, the function can also perform a full calibration of each of
 * the two cameras. However, due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space and noise in the
 * input data, the function can diverge from the correct solution. If the intrinsic parameters can be
 * estimated with high accuracy for each of the cameras individually (for example, using
 * #calibrateCamera ), you are recommended to do so and then pass REF: CALIB_FIX_INTRINSIC flag to the
 * function along with the computed intrinsic parameters. Otherwise, if all the parameters are
 * estimated at once, it makes sense to restrict some parameters, for example, pass
 *  REF: CALIB_SAME_FOCAL_LENGTH and REF: CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST flags, which is usually a
 * reasonable assumption.
 *
 * Similarly to #calibrateCamera, the function minimizes the total re-projection error for all the
 * points in all the available views from both cameras. The function returns the final value of the
 * re-projection error.

/**
 * Computes rectification transforms for each head of a calibrated stereo camera.
 *
 * @param cameraMatrix1 First camera intrinsic matrix.
 * @param distCoeffs1 First camera distortion parameters.
 * @param cameraMatrix2 Second camera intrinsic matrix.
 * @param distCoeffs2 Second camera distortion parameters.
 * @param imageSize Size of the image used for stereo calibration.
 * @param R Rotation matrix from the coordinate system of the first camera to the second camera,
 * see REF: stereoCalibrate.
 * @param T Translation vector from the coordinate system of the first camera to the second camera,
 * see REF: stereoCalibrate.
 * @param R1 Output 3x3 rectification transform (rotation matrix) for the first camera. This matrix
 * brings points given in the unrectified first camera's coordinate system to points in the rectified
 * first camera's coordinate system. In more technical terms, it performs a change of basis from the
 * unrectified first camera's coordinate system to the rectified first camera's coordinate system.
 * @param R2 Output 3x3 rectification transform (rotation matrix) for the second camera. This matrix
 * brings points given in the unrectified second camera's coordinate system to points in the rectified
 * second camera's coordinate system. In more technical terms, it performs a change of basis from the
 * unrectified second camera's coordinate system to the rectified second camera's coordinate system.
 * @param P1 Output 3x4 projection matrix in the new (rectified) coordinate systems for the first
 * camera, i.e. it projects points given in the rectified first camera coordinate system into the
 * rectified first camera's image.
 * @param P2 Output 3x4 projection matrix in the new (rectified) coordinate systems for the second
 * camera, i.e. it projects points given in the rectified first camera coordinate system into the
 * rectified second camera's image.
 * @param Q Output `$$4 \times 4$$` disparity-to-depth mapping matrix (see REF: reprojectImageTo3D).
 * @param flags Operation flags that may be zero or REF: CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY . If the flag is set,
 * the function makes the principal points of each camera have the same pixel coordinates in the
 * rectified views. And if the flag is not set, the function may still shift the images in the
 * horizontal or vertical direction (depending on the orientation of epipolar lines) to maximize the
 * useful image area.
 * @param alpha Free scaling parameter. If it is -1 or absent, the function performs the default
 * scaling. Otherwise, the parameter should be between 0 and 1. alpha=0 means that the rectified
 * images are zoomed and shifted so that only valid pixels are visible (no black areas after
 * rectification). alpha=1 means that the rectified image is decimated and shifted so that all the
 * pixels from the original images from the cameras are retained in the rectified images (no source
 * image pixels are lost). Any intermediate value yields an intermediate result between
 * those two extreme cases.
 * @param newImageSize New image resolution after rectification. The same size should be passed to
 * #initUndistortRectifyMap (see the stereo_calib.cpp sample in OpenCV samples directory). When (0,0)
 * is passed (default), it is set to the original imageSize . Setting it to a larger value can help you
 * preserve details in the original image, especially when there is a big radial distortion.
 * @param validPixROI1 Optional output rectangles inside the rectified images where all the pixels
 * are valid. If alpha=0 , the ROIs cover the whole images. Otherwise, they are likely to be smaller
 * (see the picture below).
 * @param validPixROI2 Optional output rectangles inside the rectified images where all the pixels
 * are valid. If alpha=0 , the ROIs cover the whole images. Otherwise, they are likely to be smaller
 * (see the picture below).
 *
 * The function computes the rotation matrices for each camera that (virtually) make both camera image
 * planes the same plane. Consequently, this makes all the epipolar lines parallel and thus simplifies
 * the dense stereo correspondence problem. The function takes the matrices computed by #stereoCalibrate
 * as input. As output, it provides two rotation matrices and also two projection matrices in the new
 * coordinates. The function distinguishes the following two cases:
 *
 * -   **Horizontal stereo**: the first and the second camera views are shifted relative to each other
 *     mainly along the x-axis (with possible small vertical shift). In the rectified images, the
 *     corresponding epipolar lines in the left and right cameras are horizontal and have the same
 *     y-coordinate. P1 and P2 look like:
 *
 *     `$$\texttt{P1} = \begin{bmatrix}
 *                         f & 0 & cx_1 & 0 \\
 *                         0 & f & cy & 0 \\
 *                         0 & 0 & 1 & 0
 *                      \end{bmatrix}$$`
 *
 *     `$$\texttt{P2} = \begin{bmatrix}
 *                         f & 0 & cx_2 & T_x*f \\
 *                         0 & f & cy & 0 \\
 *                         0 & 0 & 1 & 0
 *                      \end{bmatrix} ,$$`
 *
 *     where `$$T_x$$` is a horizontal shift between the cameras and `$$cx_1=cx_2$$` if
 *     REF: CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY is set.
 *
 * -   **Vertical stereo**: the first and the second camera views are shifted relative to each other
 *     mainly in the vertical direction (and probably a bit in the horizontal direction too). The epipolar
 *     lines in the rectified images are vertical and have the same x-coordinate. P1 and P2 look like:
 *
 *     `$$\texttt{P1} = \begin{bmatrix}
 *                         f & 0 & cx & 0 \\
 *                         0 & f & cy_1 & 0 \\
 *                         0 & 0 & 1 & 0
 *                      \end{bmatrix}$$`
 *
 *     `$$\texttt{P2} = \begin{bmatrix}
 *                         f & 0 & cx & 0 \\
 *                         0 & f & cy_2 & T_y*f \\
 *                         0 & 0 & 1 & 0
 *                      \end{bmatrix},$$`
 *
 *     where `$$T_y$$` is a vertical shift between the cameras and `$$cy_1=cy_2$$` if
 *     REF: CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY is set.
 *
 * As you can see, the first three columns of P1 and P2 will effectively be the new "rectified" camera
 * matrices. The matrices, together with R1 and R2 , can then be passed to #initUndistortRectifyMap to
 * initialize the rectification map for each camera.
 *
 * See below the screenshot from the stereo_calib.cpp sample. Some red horizontal lines pass through
 * the corresponding image regions. This means that the images are well rectified, which is what most
 * stereo correspondence algorithms rely on. The green rectangles are roi1 and roi2 . You see that
 * their interiors are all valid pixels.

 *

 *
 *     where `$$T_x$$` is a horizontal shift between the cameras and `$$cx_1=cx_2$$` if

 *
 * -   **Vertical stereo**: the first and the second camera views are shifted relative to each other
 *     mainly in the vertical direction (and probably a bit in the horizontal direction too). The epipolar
 *     lines in the rectified images are vertical and have the same x-coordinate. P1 and P2 look like:

 *
 * The function performs the Hand-Eye calibration using various methods. One approach consists in estimating the

 *   - R. Tsai, R. Lenz A New Technique for Fully Autonomous and Efficient 3D Robotics Hand/EyeCalibration \cite Tsai89
 *   - F. Park, B. Martin Robot Sensor Calibration: Solving AX = XB on the Euclidean Group \cite Park94
 *   - R. Horaud, F. Dornaika Hand-Eye Calibration \cite Horaud95
 *
 * Another approach consists in estimating simultaneously the rotation and the translation (simultaneous solutions),
 * with the following implemented methods:
 *   - N. Andreff, R. Horaud, B. Espiau On-line Hand-Eye Calibration \cite Andreff99
 *   - K. Daniilidis Hand-Eye Calibration Using Dual Quaternions \cite Daniilidis98
 *
 * The following picture describes the Hand-Eye calibration problem where the transformation between a camera ("eye")
 * mounted on a robot gripper ("hand") has to be estimated. This configuration is called eye-in-hand.
 *
 * The eye-to-hand configuration consists in a static camera observing a calibration pattern mounted on the robot
 * end-effector. The transformation from the camera to the robot base frame can then be estimated by inputting
 * the suitable transformations to the function, see below.
 *
 * ![](pics/hand-eye_figure.png)
 *
 * The calibration procedure is the following:
 *   - a static calibration pattern is used to estimate the transformation between the target frame
 *   and the camera frame
 *   - the robot gripper is moved in order to acquire several poses
 *   - for each pose, the homogeneous transformation between the gripper frame and the robot base frame is recorded using for
 *   instance the robot kinematics
 * `$$
 *     \begin{bmatrix}
 *     X_b\\
 *     Y_b\\
 *     Z_b\\
 *     1
 *     \end{bmatrix}
