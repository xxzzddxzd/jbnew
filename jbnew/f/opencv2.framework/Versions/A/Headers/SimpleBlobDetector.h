// C++: class SimpleBlobDetector
/**
 * Class for extracting blobs from an image. :
 *
 * The class implements a simple algorithm for extracting blobs from an image:
 *
 * 1.  Convert the source image to binary images by applying thresholding with several thresholds from
 *     minThreshold (inclusive) to maxThreshold (exclusive) with distance thresholdStep between
 *     neighboring thresholds.
 * 2.  Extract connected components from every binary image by findContours and calculate their
 *     centers.
 * 3.  Group centers from several binary images by their coordinates. Close centers form one group that
 *     corresponds to one blob, which is controlled by the minDistBetweenBlobs parameter.
 * 4.  From the groups, estimate final centers of blobs and their radiuses and return as locations and
 *     sizes of keypoints.
 *
 * This class performs several filtrations of returned blobs. You should set filterBy\* to true/false
 * to turn on/off corresponding filtration. Available filtrations:
 *
 * -   **By color**. This filter compares the intensity of a binary image at the center of a blob to
 * blobColor. If they differ, the blob is filtered out. Use blobColor = 0 to extract dark blobs
 * and blobColor = 255 to extract light blobs.
 * -   **By area**. Extracted blobs have an area between minArea (inclusive) and maxArea (exclusive).
 * -   **By circularity**. Extracted blobs have circularity
 * (`$$\frac{4*\pi*Area}{perimeter * perimeter}$$`) between minCircularity (inclusive) and
 * maxCircularity (exclusive).
 * -   **By ratio of the minimum inertia to maximum inertia**. Extracted blobs have this ratio
 * between minInertiaRatio (inclusive) and maxInertiaRatio (exclusive).
 * -   **By convexity**. Extracted blobs have convexity (area / area of blob convex hull) between
 * minConvexity (inclusive) and maxConvexity (exclusive).
 *
 * Default values of parameters are tuned to extract dark circular blobs.
 *
 * Member of `Features2d`
